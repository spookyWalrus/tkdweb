Files in /nx orgi and /nx orig comps are the first rendition of files that are closest to files 
from https://i18nexus.com/tutorials/nextjs/react-i18next . These files do compile and work, however, 
the TranslationProvider is based on the page.js and not at root layout.js

Files that are in /nx are slightly refactored from chatgpt and wrap root layout.js. 
Doesn't compile as it ends up in a loop somewhere, Run time Error: Maximum call stack size exceeded

Files that are in current directory are the second suggested refactoring of files. Very similar 
to files in /nx where chatgpt gave suggestion on how to not have recursive loop, but unfortunnately
the site doesn't compile. Ends up ultimately with same call stack max out error.

The layout.js file in /og directory is the file without any changes to accomodate i18next.js

For all other examples of unmodfieid files, say, layout.js, look at source node of main branch where this
branch, i18next, was based on


React-i18next v15.4.1 is compatible with React 18+ and should work with Next.js v13.5.7.
I18next v23.7.7 is compatible with react-i18next and Next.js.

Upgraded react-i18next package while downgraded i18next package, to try remedy the other error
that came up: "TypeError: (0 , react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.createContext) is not a function"
