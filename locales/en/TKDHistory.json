{"History Header":"The History of Taekwondo","History-p1":"Taekwondo is a Korean martial art that blends ancient traditions with modern influences. Its roots trace back over 2,000 years to early Korean martial arts like Taekkyeon and Subak, which were practiced during the Three Kingdoms period (Goguryeo, Silla, and Baekje). These techniques were used both for combat and personal development.","History-p2":"During the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910–1945), traditional martial arts were suppressed, and Japanese karate influenced many Korean martial artists. After Korea's liberation, various martial arts schools, called \"kwans\", emerged—each combining native Korean styles with elements from karate and Chinese martial arts.","History-p3":"In 1955, a unified martial art was formally named Taekwondo, meaning \"the way of the foot and fist.\" General Choi Hong Hi played a key role in this process and is often credited as the founder of modern Taekwondo.","History-p4":"Taekwondo gained global popularity in the second half of the 20th century. It became an official Olympic sport in 2000, highlighting its emphasis on high, fast kicks and athleticism. Today, it's practiced by millions worldwide for self-defense, sport, fitness, and personal discipline."}
