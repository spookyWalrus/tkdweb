The black belt student generally begins to spontaneously recognize their own mistakes and weaknesses.","Text3":"A good black belt is not necessarily a good fighter, but rather someone who demonstrates positive and constructive behavior in their taekwondo practice and in life in general.\nConversely, a good fighter is not necessarily a good black belt.
