This is the TKD rawdon website.
Our content is managed by Wordpress (or maybe Strapi??), with a MySQL database. Since we use NextJS, our back-end is all managed through the framework instead of setting up a designated back-end. Eventually, we'll set up a Node back-end if we need to manage payment processing. We'll keep you posted!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

We're using [Bulma](https://bulma.io) for our CSS library.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
